The application parses prices for cs:go skins from the steamcommunity market every 5 seconds by net/http and html parser.
If new skins with lower prices appear on market the program will show it.
Used net/http, context, fmt, strings, time.
I was little bit confused while using context and there is one bag that I could not fix.
